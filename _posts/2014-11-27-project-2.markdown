description: My second major game idea, Not Another Typing Game was a really fun, ambitious project I had. The player types words on the screen to complete actions. Kinda like the terminal! Sounds bland, but the developments I had for it in my head and on docs was really awesome (in my biased opinion). I never got around to completing it, but it was a valuable experience nontheless. I got intimate with the SDL2.0 library in C++ and learned a lot about sprite animation and game loops. Maybe I will revisit this project one day, as it is a really cool idea and I still look at the design docs sometimes.
