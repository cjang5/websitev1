description: One of the coolest things I've made so far, this program will take in a source image and then turn it into a mosaic given a pool of images to choose from! It uses a kd-tree data structure to decide which images to use to make up the new mosaic, and it does this relatively efficiently using a Nearest Neighbor Search and Quick-Select algorithm. I made this for school, but I thought I'd show it off as it is something I'm pretty proud of.
